# Schizochytrium-Biodiesel-Analysis
## Analysis of the physical and chemical combustion properties of schizochytrium algal biodiesel and its diesel blends. 

### Density, surface tension and kinematic viscocity
The code is built out from initially deriving the density, viscocity, and surface tension for schizochytrium biodiesel using its FAME profile. Then doing the same for diesel and heavy fuel oil. 


### Vapour pressure, diffusivity, latent heat of vapourisation and critical properties 
The critical point in thermodynamics dsecribes the end point of a phase equilibrium relarionship. In the case of fuels the liquid-vapour critical point is of most interest. It is defined as the point at which under the given conditions a liquid and vapour can coexist. This point is essential to calculate the vapour pressure, diffusivity and latent heat of vapourisation discussed below. 

Analysis of the vapour pressure, diffusivity and latent heat of vapourisation of the fuels was undertaken as these properties have direct influence over the initial combustion of a fuel post injection. 

      Vapour diffusivity= speed of diffusion of fuel into air inside combustion chamber
          Influences evaporation through its effect on vapour dispersion rate
      
      Vapour pressure= degree to which a fuel vaporises at a specific temperature
           Important as must meet minimum vapour pressure to ensure suitable volatility under cold start conditions, must not meet maximum vapour pressure to prevent vapour blocks 
           in the fuel line. 
           
      Latent heat of vapourisation= heat input required for a fuel to vaporise
           Reduced latent heat of vapourisation means a fuel vapoirses better at lower temperatures improving combustion performance
           
### Breakup length, spray tip penetration and spray angle
A critical part of fuel analysis that needed to be considered was the injection process. This was modelled using the above parameters to compare the performance of the fuels. Breakup length describes the
